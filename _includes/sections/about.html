<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I pursue Electronics and Communication engineering at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of technology. Currently in 2nd year, quite content with whatever I'm doing. <br>
	I live and am brought up in Surat, Gujarat, India. My natural habitat is sitting in a corner with my laptop and earplugs, a tight bubble of total focus. I love reading philosophies and self-help books. I chill out with horror movies. <br>
	I started development with web technologies and embedded, now diving deep into machine learning and deep learning. 
	I love mathematics and its endless possibilities. <br>
	I'm up for any kind of collaboration which includes building something. Anything. 
	I love learning different technologies and make applications with or without purpose. I've some mini learning projects in my bag. I love building stuff with something I've no idea about, and learn on the way. Apart from these, I write blogs sometimes.
