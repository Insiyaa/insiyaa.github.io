On a boring weekend while trying to kill some time, a friend of mine recommended me a video[^1] on YouTube which inspired me to write some code to make patterns like below.

This is called *Modular Multiplication on a Circle(Times table)*. Here I’ll walk through a tutorial on how you can make this yourself.

To make these patterns, the circle is first divided into *n* equal parts. They’re numbered from *0* to *n — 1*.

![Here the circle is divided into 26 parts (0 to 25). The 26th part corresponds to 0, 27 to 1 and so on.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0Y3J_fIyAvZKcAs_5AlexQ.png)

Each part is then joined with its *kth* multiple. The pattern shown below is made with *k* = 7. Which means that 1 is connected with 7, 2 with 14, 3 with 21 and so on. Doing this for above setup, gives the following pattern.

![k = 7](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YYqjopvv7CGeeVJkA70u_Q.png)

Doing the above procedure for a large number of parts give rise to some beautiful patterns.
Let's make them using *HTML Canvas*.

First lets initialize the canvas and draw the main circle.  
Circles are drawn with `.arc()` method.


{% highlight js %}

var canvas =  document.querySelector('canvas');
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;                       
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;  
                                             
//c stands for context                       
var c = canvas.getContext('2d');                                              
// Master Circle
// a and b corresponds to center of the circle                       
var a = 400, b = 300, radius = 200; 
c.beginPath();     
c.stroke();
c.arc(a, b, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2, false);

{% endhighlight %}

The first checkpoint of the code would be to divide the circle in n-parts and get their coordinates for later use.

{% highlight js %}

var arc_len = 2 * Math.PI * radius / n;                       
var dtheta = arc_len / radius;                       
var x = a - radius;                       
var y = b;
var n = 300;                       
var theta = 0;                                               
var coorArray = [];                       
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {                                                   
  coorArray.push([x,y]);                                                   
  theta += dtheta;                           
  x = a - (radius * Math.cos(theta));                           
  y = b - (radius * Math.sin(theta));                               
}

{% endhighlight %}

And the final part to join the points with their index multiplied by *k*. `.moveTo()` and `.lineTo()` are used to specify start and end points. And finally `.stroke()` method to draw it.

{% highlight js %}

var endp;                       
var times = 8;                       
var r = Math.random() * 255;                       
var g = Math.random() * 255;                       
var b = Math.random() * 255;                       
c.strokeStyle = 'rgba('+r+','+g+','+b+',1)';                                               
for (let i = 0; i < coorArray.length; i++) {                             
  c.beginPath();                             
  c.moveTo(...coorArray[i]);                           
  endp = times * i >= n ? (times * i) % n : times * i;                                                        
  c.lineTo(...coorArray[endp]);                             
  c.stroke();                          
}

{% endhighlight %}

Also added some random colors for visual appeal ;).
