								<h2>Why I chose this project?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I wanted to participate in this program from a long time. I was really nervous when the organizations were announced. All the questions flooded in my mind like will I be able to do it? Will I find the right project for me? I started shortlisting some organizations based on my skill sets. I majorly worked on machine learning the whole 2018 and also had some previous experience in JavaScript. I definitely didn't want to do anything purely web but. So after going through many of them, I can down to two organizations - BMI, Emory University and Red Hen Labs.
							</p>
							<p>
								This project initially caught my interest as it was literally a combo of all the skills I had and all the things I wanted to work on. I've been interested in medical data since a long time. And, this project focused on browser-based models on such data, made me feel really enthusiastic to dig deeper and think of all the ways CaMicroscope could be improved. I'm really happy and grateful to be able to work on this project this summers!
							</p>
							<p>
								The following are the tasks for me this summer:
								<ul>
									<li>Creating a workflow to allow model developers to allow their model to be run on a selected image or region of interest by the client, to identify cellular features or cancer.</li>
									<li>Add the latest deep learning models researched in the area of digital pathology to caMicroscope to help the pathologists.</li>
									<li>Improve the segmentation app.</li>
									<li>A tutorial to enable users to make models compatible with caMicroscope.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Further in this blog, I will document about the components I'll be using to complete this project.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h2>1. Docker</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								CaMicroscope and all its components are available as a Docker Distribution. At first, all I had to use about docker was to <em>build</em> and <em>up</em> the container. But as I started to understand how the whole stack comes together, I read more about it.
							</p>
							<p>
								The one issue I faced was that everytime I made any changes to the <em>viewer</em>, I had to rebuild the container. This was quite annoying. I googled but didn't find any satisfactory results. So, I asked my mentors and they suggested to mount the volume. So I went ahead and read about the file system of docker and volumes.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Docker File System</b> <br>
								Docker container is created from a read-only template called docker image. Each Docker image references a list of read-only layers that represent filesystem differences. Layers are stacked on top of each other to form a base for a container’s root filesystem. The Docker storage driver is responsible for stacking these layers and providing a single unified view. When we start a container, Docker takes the read-only image and adds a read-write layer on top. If the running container modifies an existing file, the file is copied out of the underlying read-only layer and into the top-most read-write layer where the changes are applied. The version in the read-write layer hides the underlying file, but does not destroy it — it still exists in the underlying layer. When the container is deleted the read-write layer is also deleted but the underlying image remains unchanged. Docker calls this combination of read-only layers with a read-write layer on top a <em>Union File System</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>The solution</b> to the issue I faced was <em>volumes</em>. It is Docker’s mechanism for managing files outside the lifecycle of the container. It allows accessing files on the host from the container. 
								In other words, volumes are directories (or files) that are outside of the default Union File System and exist as normal directories and files on the host filesystem. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Since we're using docker-compose as it's multi-container environment, all I had to do was to add <code>../caMicroscope/apps:/var/www/html/apps</code> under the volumes of the <em>viewer</em> in the config file. I found docker really fascinating!
