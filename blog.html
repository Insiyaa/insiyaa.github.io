							This project extends the existing CaMicroscope which is A Web Based Annotation and Visualization Platform for Digitized Whole Slide Images.
							The following are the tasks for me this summer:
							<ul>
								<li>Creating a workflow to allow model developers to allow their model to be run on a selected image or region of interest by the client, to identify cellular features or cancer.</li>
								<li>Add the latest deep learning models researched in the area of digital pathology to caMicroscope to help the pathologists.</li>
								<li>Improve the segmentation app.</li>
								<li>A tutorial to enable users to make models compatible with caMicroscope.</li>
							</ul>

								<h2>Why I chose this project?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I wanted to participate in this program from a long time. I was really nervous when the organizations were announced. All the questions flooded in my mind like will I be able to do it? Will I find the right project for me? I started shortlisting some organizations based on my skill sets. I majorly worked on machine learning the whole 2018 and also had some previous experience in JavaScript. I definitely didn't want to do anything purely web but. So after going through many of them, I can down to two organizations - BMI, Emory University and Red Hen Labs.
							</p>
							<p>
								This project initially caught my interest as it was literally a combo of all the skills I had and all the things I wanted to work on. I've been interested in medical data since a long time. And, this project focused on browser-based models on such data, made me feel really enthusiastic to dig deeper and think of all the ways CaMicroscope could be improved. I'm really happy and grateful to be able to work on this project this summers!

								Further in this blog, I will document about the components I'll be using to complete this project.
