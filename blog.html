								<h2>Why I chose this project?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I wanted to participate in this program since a long time. I was really nervous when the organizations were announced. My mind was flooded with multiple questions, including whether or not I'll be able to do it? Will I find the right project for me? I started shortlisting some organizations based on my skill sets. I had devoted most of time in the year 2018 working on machine learning and deep learning, with a previous experience in JS. I definitely didn't want to do anything purely web. So after going through many of them, I can down to two organizations - BMI, Emory University and Red Hen Labs.
							</p>
							<p>
								This project initially caught my interest as it was literally a combo of all the skills I had and all the things I wanted to work on. I've been interested in medical data since a long time. This project focuses on browser-based models on such data which intensified my enthusiasm to dig deeper and think of all the ways CaMicroscope could be improved. I'm really happy and grateful to be able to work on this project this summers!
							</p>
							<p>
								The following are the tasks for me this summer:
								<ul>
									<li>Creating a workflow to allow model developers to allow their model to be run on a selected image or region of interest by the client, to identify cellular features or cancer.</li>
									<li>Add the latest deep learning models researched in the area of digital pathology to caMicroscope to help the pathologists.</li>
									<li>Improve the segmentation app.</li>
									<li>A tutorial to enable users to make models compatible with caMicroscope.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Further in this blog, I will document about the components I'll be using to complete this project.
							</p>
							<header class="major" id="1">
								<h2>1. Docker</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								CaMicroscope and all its components are available as a Docker Distribution. At first, all I had to use about docker was to <em>build</em> and <em>up</em> the container. But as I started to understand how the whole stack comes together, I read more about it.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>The issue</b> I faced was that everytime I made any changes to the <em>viewer</em>, I had to rebuild the container. This was quite annoying. I googled but didn't find any satisfactory results. So, I asked my mentors and they suggested to mount the volume. So I went ahead and read about the file system of docker and volumes.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Docker File System</b> <br>
								Docker container is created from a read-only template called docker image. Each Docker image references a list of read-only layers that represent filesystem differences. Layers are stacked on top of each other to form a base for a container’s root filesystem. The Docker storage driver is responsible for stacking these layers and providing a single unified view. When we start a container, Docker takes the read-only image and adds a read-write layer on top. If the running container modifies an existing file, the file is copied out of the underlying read-only layer and into the top-most read-write layer where the changes are applied. The version in the read-write layer hides the underlying file, but does not destroy it — it still exists in the underlying layer. When the container is deleted the read-write layer is also deleted but the underlying image remains unchanged. Docker calls this combination of read-only layers with a read-write layer on top a <em>Union File System</em>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>The solution</b> to the issue I faced was <em>volumes</em>. It is Docker’s mechanism for managing files outside the lifecycle of the container. It allows accessing files on the host from the container. 
								In other words, volumes are directories (or files) that are outside of the default Union File System and exist as normal directories and files on the host filesystem. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Since we're using docker-compose as it's multi-container environment, all I had to do was to add <code>../caMicroscope/apps:/var/www/html/apps</code> under the volumes of the <em>viewer</em> in the config file. I found docker really fascinating!
							</p>
							<header class="major" id="1">
								<h2>2. About JS</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I've been working ON-OFF with JavaScript for more than a year now. It is literally impossible to avoid getting back to it accounting to the accessibility the language provides. It's nearly impossible to master this language! Everytime I work with it, I learn something. Further, I'll be talking about standard functions and arrow functions.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Arrow functions and <em>this</em> binding</b> <br>
								ES6 arrow function is the alternative syntax for the standard ES5 function. Basic syntax is:<br> 
								<code>(param1, param2, …, paramN) => { statements } </code> <br>
								I'd like to talk about the difference between ES5 function and arrow function - the <em>this</em> binding. <br>
								The arrow functions don't bind their own <em>this</em> value. Instead, the <em>this</em> value of the scope in which it was defined is accessible. The following example will make the above statement more clear.
								
<pre style="color: #E8448C; margin: 0 auto;"> <code>const event = {
	name: 'Birthday Party',
	guestList: ['Andrew', 'Jen', 'Mike'],
	printGuestList() {
		console.log('Guest list for ' + this.name)
		this.guestList.forEach((guest) => {
			console.log(guest + ' is attending ' + this.name)
		})
	}
}
event.printGuestList()</code> </pre>

								The arrow function passed to <em>forEach</em> is able to access <em>this.name</em> correctly, as it’s defined as an arrow function and doesn’t have a this binding of its own. That code wouldn’t work if you swapped out the arrow function for a standard function as it won't be able to access the <em>this</em> of the object it is declared into. <br>
								It would work for the following variation in <em>printGuestList</em> function: <br><br>
								
<pre style="color: #E8448C"><code>printGuestList() {
	var that = this
	console.log('Guest list for ' + this.name)
	this.guestList.forEach(function(guest){
		console.log(guest + ' is attending ' + that.name)
	})
}</code></pre>	
								Here, we're declaring a variable with the <em>this</em> value for the function to access. <br> <br>					
								
<pre style="color: #E8448C"><code>printGuestList() {
	console.log('Guest list for ' + this.name)
	this.guestList.forEach(function(guest){
		console.log(guest + ' is attending ' + this.name)
	}.bind(this))
}</code></pre>
								Here, we're binding the <em>this</em> to the function. <br>
								Arrow functions come handy in such situations.
